Tech Academy C# Live Project Code Summary
<h1>Introduction</h1>
For my final two weeks of my time at the Tech Academy, I worked on a team with my fellow students to help develop a new content management system(CMS) for a local theatre/acting company's website. This project was built using ASP .NET MVC and Entity Framework using C#. This interactive MVC web application allows the managing of content for users who are not techincally savy and want to easily manage what displays on their website. For this project we utilized an Agile work environment framework and SCRUM processes, which  involved daily standups and weekly code retrospectives during the two week sprint.
